# Projects

## SIEM on Azure: Monitoring, Alerts, and Threat Intelligence 
#### Description:
Implemented a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system on Microsoft Azure, leveraging Microsoft Sentinel and
Log Analytics for comprehensive monitoring and alerting.


#### Key Achievements:

-Set up a virtual machine and resource group to host the SIEM solution.

-Configured Microsoft Sentinel to integrate with Log Analytics, enabling real-time security monitoring.

-Developed and deployed a custom Sentinel rule to detect unauthorized RDP sign-ins, leading to the logging of over 10,000
security events within the first hour of operation.

-Gained hands-on experience with SIEM tools, threat intelligence, and data collection, enhancing incident detection and
response capabilities.


#### Skills Demonstrated:

-SIEM deployment and configuration

-Threat detection and incident response

-Log analysis and monitoring

# Coding Projects

## Random Password Generator with GUI

#### Summary:

This tool simplifies password generation with a GUI, making it accessible to users of all levels and adaptable for various security needs.


#### Features:

-Password Generation: Creates random passwords with letters, numbers, and symbols. 

-GUI Interface: Allows users to specify password length and character sets via a user-friendly window. 


#### How It Works Setup: 
Utilizes random for generating characters and tkinter for the GUI. Functionality: Users enter the desired password length
and choose character options. The generated password is displayed directly in the GUI.


## Encrypted Password Manager in Python

#### Summary:

This project is a secure password manager that uses cryptography to encrypt and store user passwords, ensuring data protection from unauthorized access.

#### Features:

-Password Encryption: Encrypts passwords using the Fernet symmetric encryption method.

-Key-Based Access: Users generate and load encryption keys to access stored passwords.

-Password Management: Allows users to create, store, and retrieve passwords from encrypted files.

-User-Friendly Menu: Offers intuitive options to create new keys, load existing keys, add new passwords, and retrieve
passwords.

#### How It Works:

-Setup: Developed in Python using the cryptography library for encryption and decryption functions.

-Functionality: The program encrypts passwords and stores them in files. A generated key allows secure access to these
passwords, which are stored in a password dictionary. A menu-based system enables password management tasks such as file
creation and password retrieval.

## Keylogger in Python

#### Summary:

This project demonstrates the creation of a keylogger in Python that captures and logs keystrokes into a text file, with
additional functionality to convert the script into an executable for deployment.

#### Features:

-Keystroke Logging: Captures and logs every keystroke into a text file.

-File Management: Automatically creates a log file if one does not exist and writes all captured keystrokes to it.

-Error Handling: Ensures the program continues running by logging errors when certain characters can’t be captured.

-Executable
