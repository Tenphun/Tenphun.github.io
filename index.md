## SIEM on Azure: Monitoring, Alerts, and Threat Intelligence 
#### Description:
Implemented a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system on Microsoft Azure, leveraging Microsoft Sentinel and
Log Analytics for comprehensive monitoring and alerting.


#### Key Achievements:

-Set up a virtual machine and resource group to host the SIEM solution.

-Configured Microsoft Sentinel to integrate with Log Analytics, enabling real-time security monitoring.

-Developed and deployed a custom Sentinel rule to detect unauthorized RDP sign-ins, leading to the logging of over 10,000
security events within the first hour of operation.

-Gained hands-on experience with SIEM tools, threat intelligence, and data collection, enhancing incident detection and
response capabilities.


#### Skills Demonstrated:

-SIEM deployment and configuration

-Threat detection and incident response

-Log analysis and monitoring

## Home Server Project
#### Description:
Built and configured a home server running Linux, focusing on implementing robust security measures and optimizing server
performance.


#### Key Achievements:

-Established a secure Linux-based home server environment with firewall rules and non-root user accounts to enhance
security.

-Documented the entire setup process, including troubleshooting challenges related to SSH access, IP configuration, and

-Docker container management.

-Applied practical knowledge in network management, server hardening, and cybersecurity best practices, refining skills 
through hands-on experience.


#### Skills Demonstrated:

-Linux server setup and configuration

-Network security and firewall management

## Cybersecurity Blog

#### Description:
Maintained a personal blog, "Phuntsokâ€™s Net," dedicated to documenting and sharing insights into cybersecurity concepts and
practices.


#### Key Achievements:

-Published articles on various topics, including Capture the Flag (CTF) exercises, homelab setup, Linux installation, and
cybersecurity events.

-Analyzed and explained recent cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, such as the IPv6 bug (CVE-2024-38063), to educate
readers on potential risks and mitigation strategies.

-Developed practical skills in Linux, server configuration, and coding projects like a random password generator and an
encrypted password manager.

#### Skills Demonstrated:

## Random Password Generator with GUI

#### Summary:

This tool simplifies password generation with a GUI, making it accessible to users of all levels and adaptable for various security needs.


#### Features:

-Password Generation: Creates random passwords with letters, numbers, and symbols. 

-GUI Interface: Allows users to specify password length and character sets via a user-friendly window. 


#### How It Works Setup: 
Utilizes random for generating characters and tkinter for the GUI. Functionality: Users enter the desired password length
and choose character options. The generated password is displayed directly in the GUI.
